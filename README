# REAPER Go Extension

A Go-based extension for REAPER using CGO.

This project is an experiment to create REAPER extensions using Go with CGO to bridge to the C++ REAPER API.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/conormkelly/reaper-golang-extension.git

   ```

2. Build the extension:

   ```sh
   make install
   ```

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Go and C bridge code for the extension
- `build/` - Output directory for compiled files
- `sdk/` - REAPER SDK headers
- `WDL/` - WDL dependency required by the SDK
